# Railway Track Crack Detection System

Railways are the most important modes of transportation .The criss-cross tracks are almost present in every part of India. Keeping in mind the security of people and also the free running railway without any problem, we have to focus on the safety part of this system. The project railway crack and object detection is a forward step to improving the railway system. In this project we mainly focused on safety. This project makes the Indian railway more reliable. The system performs two main functions. The first one is detecting the crack on the railway track by using the IR sensor and the second one is detecting the object by using the pir sensor. Also, the location is sent where the fatal cracks are present ,including the moving objects by using the GPS and GSM module. The GSM will send the SMS to the mobile based application which is monitored by the authority. The authorities get alert and send the manpower as required according to the situation.
